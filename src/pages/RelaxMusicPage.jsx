              A sensation of vibration is experienced during audible ‘OM’
              chanting. This has the potential for vagus nerve stimulation
              through its auricular branches and the effects on the brain
              thereof. The neurohemodynamic correlates of ‘OM’ chanting are yet
              to be explored.

                Om or Aum is the most powerful mantra. It’s not just the sound,
                but the vibrations that impact the mind, body and soul, making
                way for a happy, blissful and calm state. Om is an ancient,
                sacred word from the eastern spiritual traditions of Yoga,
                Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Only at higher frequencies can
                we learn to let go of desires and be happy with nature. In
                today’s materialistic world, it is so easy to get caught up in
                stress, fear, anxiety, worry, etc.

            Om is the highest positive vibration. It is a universal syllable,
            and it is cosmic energy. According to Vedas, and the Big Bang theory
            - the whole universe was created by the sound Om (aum). Chanting Om
            raises the vibrations of an individual, not just in body but in the
            overall consciousness of one's soul and mind. Chanting Om allows you
            to align with the whole.

            What research says about Om chanting
          </Text>
          <Text as="p" fontSize="lg" textAlign={"justify"}>
            Several studies have deep-dived into the physical and mental health
            benefits of chanting Om. Some studies are offering insights into how
            the mantra benefits the mind and body. One such study, published in
            the International Journal of Yoga Therapy, looked at how Om chanting
            might be connected to the vagus nerve. This offers insight into how
            chanting can retune the nervous system by activating the vagus nerve
            and balancing the parasympathetic nervous system. During Om chanting
            the vibration felt in the head and ears can be linked to the vagus
            nerve which has auricular (ear) branches. Therefore, this study
            hypothesized that chanting Om might stimulate the vagus nerve,
            producing a similar deactivation of the limbic system. This is an
            important factor as low vagal tone is associated with a weak ability
            to deal with stress, poor digestion, elevated heart rate, and
            unstable moods. Stimulating the vagus nerve is good for our whole
            system. The National Journal of Physiology, Pharmacy and
            Pharmacology published a study that found five minutes of Om
            chanting resulted in “highly significant” reduction in blood
            pressure and pulse rate in participants with hypertension. It was
            concluded that chanting Om can be a supportive therapy for
            hypertension patients. Regular chanting helps you stay healthy -
            mentally, emotionally, physiologically and psychologically. It
            improves your inclination towards spirituality, making you a more
            positive, optimistic and calm person. The practice is unlike any
            other meditation practice. It is transformative in a fascinating and
            powerful way. You can chant the mantra silently or aloud. You can
            also chant on your own, or with a group. In fact, when you chant
            with a group the vibrations produced are outstanding and
            unbelievable. The soothing and mesmerizing effect will immediately
            make you feel relaxed and calm. So join the best online yoga classes
            and over time, you will feel a dramatic shift in your
            mind-body-spirit balance and connection.
