            Mindfulness is one effective way to decrease stress by helping you
            stay present in the moment. If youâ€™re looking to improve your own
            mindfulness techniques or are new to the practice altogether, you
            can gain practical advice from Paige Oldham and her blog Simple
            Mindfulness. Paige writes extensively about anxiety management, the
            negative health effects of stress, how to increase personal
            happiness, and other topics related to mindfulness-based strategies.

            What makes nature soothing? Spending time in nature can improve
            memory, lower stress hormones, and reduce feelings of depression or
            anxiety, among other perks. Being in nature can help clear your head
            and bring you into the present moment, and is a great way to
            de-stress and relax.

            Nature helps calm your nerves, as the tranquility of the outdoors is
            much better on your brain than loud, fast, urban environments. Find
            a bench in an easy-to-reach location and take some time to simply
            sit and relax in nature. The Metolius Preserve has some great
            benches and viewing platforms that are perfect for contemplation and
            relaxation.
